    Creates a dataclass field mapped to one or more nested JSON paths.

    This function is an alias for ``dataclasses.field(...)``, with additional
    logic for associating a field with one or more JSON key paths, including
    nested structures. It can be used to specify custom mappings between
    dataclass fields and complex, nested JSON key names.

    This mapping is **case-sensitive** and applies to the provided JSON keys
    or nested paths. For example, passing "myField" will not match "myfield"
    in JSON, and vice versa.

    `keys` represents one or more nested JSON keys (as strings or a collection of strings)
    to associate with the dataclass field. The keys can include paths like `a.b.c`
    or even more complex nested paths such as `a["nested"]["key"]`.

    Arguments:
        keys (_STR_COLLECTION): The JSON key(s) or nested path(s) to associate with the dataclass field.
        all (bool): If True (default), it also associates the reverse mapping
                    (from dataclass field to JSON path) for serialization.
                    This reverse mapping is used during `to_dict` or `to_json` instead
                    of the default key transform.
        dump (bool): If False (default is True), excludes this field from
                     serialization to JSON.
        default (Any): The default value for the field. Mutually exclusive with `default_factory`.
        default_factory (Callable[[], Any]): A callable to generate the default value.
                                             Mutually exclusive with `default`.
        init (bool): Include the field in the generated `__init__` method. Defaults to True.
        repr (bool): Include the field in the `__repr__` output. Defaults to True.
        hash (bool): Include the field in the `__hash__` method. Defaults to None.
        compare (bool): Include the field in comparison methods. Defaults to True.
        metadata (dict): Metadata to associate with the field. Defaults to None.
